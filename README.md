This is meant to be an experiment in bootstrapping an autonomous organization.

Notes: 

Borrow from the johnny-decimal framework to generalize org structure.

Considerations:

- Have repository readme's convey state.
- User-bootstrapping logic should be named sequentially.
eg.

`__00-INDEX__
01-SET_ENVs.sh
02-LAUNCH_AGENTS.sh
...
`
